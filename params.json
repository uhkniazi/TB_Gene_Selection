The factors are relevelled\r\nso that ATB is 1 and OD is 0. PCA on the samples is performed and some outliers are removed. Infinite and NA values are removed. Genes are further selected, based on if they are differentially expressed between the 2 conditions on a t.test and a wilcoxon test with BH FDR of .1% is used as a cutoff for significantly different genes between ATB and OD. Using this smaller set of genes we set aside 30% of data randomly as test set. Random Forest is classifier is run on the training set to select top 100 genes based on the variable importance (NOTE: this can take several hours to a day to finish, depending on computational resources). This set of 100 variables and the expression values in each sample are provided with the test script.\r\n\r\n# Running the script\r\n## Test Data\r\nlData.publish.rds, provided with the repository and is downloaded when the script is run.\r\n## Variable selection library\r\nCCrossValidation.R is downloaded when the script is run from the repository https://github.com/uhkniazi/CCrossValidation  \r\nThis is an S4 class R object and details of this class and its functions are provided at the main repository page. \r\n## Steps for selection\r\n1- Nested random forest to select top 30 variables.  \r\n2- Nested exhaustive subset selection to select combinations of variables that produce a good fit.  \r\n3- Nested 10 fold cross validation using LDA where the model is fit on the training set and prediction is performed on the test set for the 2 to n variable models.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
